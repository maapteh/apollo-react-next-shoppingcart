# Apollo
This example is based on the Next.JS example but not with Apollo-boost. It will show a simple shopping list with items being ordered.

## Installation

Install it and run:

```bash
yarn
yarn dev
# or
npm install
npm run dev
```

## Introduction
...

## Backend

The complete backend is mocked, so we can more easily focus on our frontend in this breef workshop. Our backend launchpad is available at:  [launchpad.graphql.com/qxz5xxlj1p](https://launchpad.graphql.com/qxz5xxlj1p) which in return gives us this graphQL endpoint [qxz5xxlj1p.lp.gql.zone/graphql](https://qxz5xxlj1p.lp.gql.zone/graphql)

## TODO

- [loonajs.com/docs/react/](https://loonajs.com/docs/react/) Loona is a state management library built on top of Apollo Client.
Instead of having a second store for your local data, keep everything in just one space.
